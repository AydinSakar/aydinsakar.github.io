I was looking for a note taking application for a while.

I use and love Microsoft OneNote, which is a part of Microsoft Office. It is a great application that auto saves everything you write. You can copy-paste web pages, Excel sheets, create new notes etc.

I also use and love [Evernote](http://evernote.com/). The big plus of Evernote is you can use it everwhere, at your desktop PC, at your mobile phone, and your tablet.

OneNote and Evernote are great for saving articles, large and formatted documents. But I was looking for an additional application, much more simpler than OneNote or Evernote. I sometimes use [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) which is a [mind mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) application, but it is also more complex and harder to use than my needs.

When I found [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/?ref=14e3069c), it felt very natural and very easy to use. I am just addicted to it now, and use it for everything I want to remember. I keep my web favorite links in Workflowy. I write my draft blog posts, project outlines, small notes about Javascript and Python. I use it for almost everything I want to remember easily. The most important reason is it is very easy to use.

Then I saw [Fargo](http://fargo.io/). I signed up, tried to understand and use it.

Here is a small comparison of these two applications.

Fargo: Fargo is a simple idea outliner, notepad, todo list, project organizer.


Workflowy: WorkFlowy is an organizational tool that makes life easier. It can help you organize personal to-dos, collaborate on large team projects, take notes, write research papers, keep a journal, plan a wedding, and much more.
