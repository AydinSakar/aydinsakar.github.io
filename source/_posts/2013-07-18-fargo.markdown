Another notetaking, todo list, outlining etc., web application which seems very promising: [Fargo.io](http://fargo.io/) brought to us by our old [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/).

Fargo uses your [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) account to save all the work you have done. That means no exporting! You always have your files in [OPML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML) format.
