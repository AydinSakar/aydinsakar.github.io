Allmost all of the eBook market is based on free-flowing eBooks, but again most of the textbooks, children books etc., are fixed page layout books.

Preparing fixed layout eBooks are easier now thanks to [ePub3](http://idpf.org/epub/30) standard which is just being adapted by the industry.

There are not too many resources for the fixed layout books. The one I found to be very helpfull is: [infogrid pacific Azardi](http://azardi.infogridpacific.com/resources.html). Thanks to these guys, I could finally manage to make an iPad friendly ePub3 Fixed Layout eBook, which I plan to write a series of tutorials on the details of the process.
